## PROBLEM STATEMENT

An Education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.

The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on website, they might browse the courses of fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from slaes team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process some leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversation rate at X Education is around 30%.

Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its leads conversion rate is very poor. For example, if say, they acquire 100 leeads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as 'Hot Leads'. If they sucessfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads. The company requires you to build a model wherein yiou need to assigh a lead  score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance. The CEO, in particular has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
